User Account Creation Script
The Script's Mission
This Bash script is designed to create user accounts on a Linux system automatically. It reads information from a text file you provide (like a list of usernames and groups) and performs the necessary commands to set up each user.

Step-by-Step Explanation
Shebang Line (#!/bin/bash)
This line tells your computer to use the Bash shell to interpret and execute the script. It's like a label saying, "Hey, run me with Bash!"

Check for Input File
The script checks if you provided a filename when you ran it. If you didn't, it tells you how to use the script (Usage: $0 <input_file>) and then stops. This is important to avoid errors.

Define Variables
Here, the script stores the filename you provided (INPUT_FILE), the path to a log file (LOG_FILE), and the path to a password file (PASSWORD_FILE) in variables. This makes the script more organized and easier to read.

Create Directories and Secure Password File
The script ensures the directories for the log file and password file exist. Then, it creates (or overwrites) the password file and sets its permissions to 600, which means only the owner (likely the root user) can read or write to it. This is crucial for security to keep passwords safe.

Define Functions
Two functions are defined:

generate_password(): This creates a random password using openssl rand.
log_message(): This adds a timestamp and the message you give it to the log file. This helps you track what the script did and when.
Read and Process Input File
The script reads your input file line by line. Each line should have a username followed by a semicolon (;) and then a comma-separated list of groups.

For each line:

The username and group list are cleaned up (extra spaces removed).
The script checks if the user already exists using id "$username". If so, it logs a message.
If not, it creates the user with their primary group (same as the username), sets their login shell to Bash (-s /bin/bash), and logs it.
It generates and sets a random password for the user, then stores the username and password in the secure password file.
If the user should belong to other groups, those groups are created (if needed) and the user is added to them. Each step is logged.
End of Script
The script logs that the user creation process is complete and tells you to check the log file for details.

Important Decisions
Password Security: The script takes password security seriously by using a random password generator and storing passwords in a file that only the root user can access.
Logging: Detailed logging helps you troubleshoot any issues that arise and track the script's activity.
Error Handling: The script checks if the input file exists and if users already exist, preventing unexpected errors.
Modular Functions: Functions like generate_password and log_message make the script more organized and reusable.
Group Management: The script creates missing groups, ensuring users are assigned to the correct groups even if they didn't exist beforehand.
